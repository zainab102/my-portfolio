        <p>
          I’m <strong>Zainab</strong>, a tech-driven Business Administration student at Royal Holloway, University of London,
          pursuing a career at the intersection of computer science and digital strategy. With hands-on experience in full stack development,
          UX/UI design, and AI-based projects, I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, automation, and user-centered design.

          My background also includes project management, digital marketing, and leadership roles in organizations like WWF and GrowBiz.
          Through continuous learning — ranging from Python and cloud tools to business intelligence and e-commerce — I combine creativity
          with technical problem-solving. I’m passionate about using technology to create meaningful, scalable impact across industries.
